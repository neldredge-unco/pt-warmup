            Here is the amusement park chain from our earlier activity.

              Use the Metropolis<mdash/>Hastings algorithm to find acceptance probabilities that result in the modified chain having the <em>uniform</em> distribution as its stationary distribution <m>\pi</m> (i.e.
              probability <m>1/4</m> on every state).

              Find the transition probabilities for the modified chain.
              Calculate the stationary distribution and/or the long-time transition matrix to verify that your modification worked.

                           To get a sense how long the modified chain takes to <q>mix</q>, calculate the eigenvalues of the transition matrix.
          We know one of them will be <m>1</m>, and in fact it will be the largest.
          Look at the <em>second</em> largest eigenvalue <m>\lambda_2</m>, in terms of its absolute value (or modulus, for eigenvalues that are complex).
          The distance between the rows of <m>p^n</m> and the stationary distribution should be approximately <m>|\lambda_2|^n</m>.
          Using this, estimate how many steps would be needed to ensure that the <m>n</m>-step transition probabilities <m>p^n</m> are within <m>0.001</m> (i.e.
          <m>10^{-3}</m>) of the (uniform) stationary distribution.
          (Try to use algebra instead of trial and error.)  What about <m>10^{-4}</m>?  <m>10^{-5}</m>?                 </p>
            </statement>

        <task workspace="1in">

                <p>
                    Compute the corresponding <m>n</m>-step transition matrices to see how close your estimates were.

                <p>
                              Suppose we instead wanted to end up with the stationary distribution <me>\pi(A) = \pi(G) = \pi(V) = 0.333, \quad \pi(P) = 0.001 </me> because for some reason we really don't like Perilous Plummet.
          Repeat the previous steps to calculate acceptance probabilities to modify the chain, and estimate how long it takes to mix to within <m>10^{-3}</m>, <m>10^{-4}</m>, <m>10^{-5}</m> of the stationary distribution.
          Think about how this compares to the uniform version, and why.
